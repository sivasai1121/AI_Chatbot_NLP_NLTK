# Simple NLP Chatbot using Python and NLTK

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the creation of a simple, rule-based conversational chatbot using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques with Python‚Äôs **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** library. The chatbot is designed to interact with users through terminal-based conversation by recognizing patterns in user input and responding with predefined replies.

The chatbot uses a technique called **pattern matching** with regular expressions to understand the structure of a user‚Äôs query and deliver relevant responses. Though basic in nature, this chatbot is a foundational demonstration of how artificial intelligence and natural language processing can be used to create conversational agents that simulate human dialogue.

This project is suitable for beginners in NLP and Python programming. It provides a clear, hands-on example of how rule-based chatbots work, what regular expressions are used for, and how simple pattern-response pairs can be mapped using the `nltk.chat.util.Chat` class. It‚Äôs also an excellent introductory project for students, hobbyists, or anyone learning how chatbots work before moving on to more advanced AI-based or deep learning-driven models.

The chatbot recognizes simple greetings like ‚Äúhello‚Äù or ‚Äúhi,‚Äù answers questions such as ‚Äúwhat is your name?‚Äù, ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù, or ‚Äúwhat can you do?‚Äù, and also provides a fallback response when it doesn‚Äôt understand the user‚Äôs input. Users can exit the chat by typing keywords such as ‚Äúbye,‚Äù ‚Äúexit,‚Äù or ‚Äúquit.‚Äù These interactions are handled through regular expressions that trigger specific response patterns.

This project was built in **Google Colab**, making it easily accessible and executable online without requiring local installations. However, the Python script can also be downloaded and run in any standard Python environment.


## Features

- Rule-based chatbot using regex pattern matching
- Terminal-based interaction
- Handles greetings, basic questions, and farewells
- Customizable responses and patterns
- Easy to understand and extend
- Lightweight and does not require external models


## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **NLTK** (`nltk.chat.util`)
- **Google Colab** or local Python IDE (e.g., VS Code, Jupyter Notebook)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Chatbot

### üü¢ Option 1: In Google Colab
1. Open Google Colab
2. Upload `nltk_chatbot.py`
3. Add this code in a cell:
   ```python
   !python nltk_chatbot.py
